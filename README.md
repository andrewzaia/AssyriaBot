## AlapBet Quiz

AssyriaBot implements an interactive AlapBet quiz game using Discord's API. The AlapBet quiz aims to educate users about Assyrian characters and their descriptions. Users can initiate the quiz in their own channel, where they will encounter multiple-choice questions related to various characters from Assyrian history and culture.

This is being expanded into various levels of increasing difficulty.

## Information Hub

In addition to the AlapBet quiz, AssyriaBot serves as an information hub about Assyria and Assyrians. It provides resources and insights into Assyrian culture, history, and heritage. This feature was created to foster recognition of the Assyrian people and their rich ancient history within the [r/Assyria](https://discord.gg/r-assyria-247923889697587200) Discord community.

## Setup
